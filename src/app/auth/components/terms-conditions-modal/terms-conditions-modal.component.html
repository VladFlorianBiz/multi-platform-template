Your **CompanyX** account lets You sign into products, websites, and services provided by **CompanyX**. You are responsible for all activities that occur in connection with Your **CompanyX** account and accept all risks of unauthorized use.

        Creating an Account. You can create a **CompanyX** account by signing up online or through a **CompanyX** product. You agree not to use any false, inaccurate or misleading information when signing up for Your **CompanyX** account. In some cases, a third party, like Your community or team, may have assigned a **CompanyX** account to You. If You received a **CompanyX** account from a third party, the third party may have additional rights over Your account, like the ability to access or delete Your account. Please review any additional terms the third party provided You, as **CompanyX** has no responsibility regarding these additional terms.

        Account Use. You must use Your **CompanyX** account to keep it active. This means that You must sign in at least once in a 2-year period to keep Your **CompanyX** account, unless otherwise provided for otherwise in a **CompanyX** Order Form between You and **CompanyX**. If You do not sign in during this time period, **CompanyX** will close Your **CompanyX** account for You. If **CompanyX** reasonably suspects that Your **CompanyX** account is being used a third party or fraudulently, **CompanyX** may suspend Your **CompanyX** account.

        Account Security. You must maintain the security of Your **CompanyX** account (for example, by not using the same password on other services) and promptly notify **CompanyX** if You discover or suspect that a third party has accessed Your **CompanyX** account without Your permission.

        Closing Your Account. You can cancel specific Services or close Your **CompanyX** Account at any time and for any reason. To close Your **CompanyX** account, please visit the website www.**CompanyX**.com or contact **CompanyX** at info@**CompanyX**.com.

        Promptly notify **CompanyX** of any loss of or damage to **CompanyX** Equipment
        If You violate any of the above terms, **CompanyX** may terminate Your right to access and use the Services and You must return any **CompanyX** Equipment to **CompanyX** immediately.

Please refer to our Protection Plan for more information.

        Other Equipment / Data Plans. You may need a connection and/or data service plan to use many of the Services. You may also need additional equipment, like a wireless or tablet device or computer. With the exception of **CompanyX** Equipment that may or may not be included in Your Services, You are responsible for providing all connections, plans, and/or equipment needed to use the Services and for paying any fees charged by the provider(s) of Your connections, plans, and equipment. Those fees are in addition to any fees You pay **CompanyX** for the Services and will not be reimbursed by **CompanyX**.

        Service Notifications. If there is something important to tell You about a Service You use, **CompanyX** will send You Service notifications to the email associated with Your **CompanyX** account. If You provided a phone number in connection with Your **CompanyX** account, **CompanyX** may send Service notifications to You via text message. Data or messaging rates may apply when receiving notifications via text messaging.

The price stated for the Services excludes all applicable taxes and currency exchange settlements, unless stated otherwise. You are solely responsible for paying such taxes or other charges. Any overdue payment will bear a late payment fee of 2% per month, or, if lower, the maximum rate allowed by law, accruing from the payment due date. We may suspend or cancel the Services if we do not receive an on time, full payment from You. Suspension or cancellation of the Services for non-payment could result in a loss of access to and use of Your account and its content.

        Your Billing Account. To pay the charges for a Service, You will be asked to provide a payment method at the time You sign up for that Service. You can access and change Your billing information and payment method on the web site www.**CompanyX**.com or by contacting **CompanyX** at info@**CompanyX**.com. Additionally, You agree to permit **CompanyX** to use any updated account information regarding Your selected payment method provided by Your issuing bank or the applicable payment network.

Also, we may charge You up to the amount You have approved, and we will notify You in advance of any change in the amount to be charged for recurring subscription Services.

        Refund Policy. Unless otherwise provided by law or by a particular Service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable. If You believe that **CompanyX** has charged You in error, You must contact us within 30-days of such charge. No refunds will be given for any charges more than 30- days old, unless otherwise required by law. We reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion.

        Canceling the Services. You may cancel a Service at any time, with or without cause. To cancel a Service and request a refund, if You are entitled to one, visit the www.**CompanyX**.com. You should refer back to the offer describing the Services as (i) You may not receive a refund at the time of cancellation; (ii) You may be obligated to pay all charges made to Your billing account for the Services before the date of cancellation; or (iii) You may lose access to and use of Your account when You cancel the Services; or (v) You may receive a refund in the amount equal to the unlinked fees You paid for a Service calculated at the time of cancellation. If You cancel, Your access to the Services ends at the end of Your current Service period or, if **CompanyX** bills Your account on a periodic basis, at the end of the period in which You canceled.

        Price Changes. **CompanyX** may change the price of the Services at any time and if You have a recurring purchase, we will notify You by email at least 15 days before the price change. If You do not agree to the price change, You must cancel and stop using the Services before the price change takes effect. If there is a fixed term and price for Your Service offer, that price will remain in force for the fixed term.

Instead, all disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or our Services will be resolved through confidential binding arbitration held in **Provcince** County, Ontario before and in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“Rules”) of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“JAMS”), which are available on the JAMS website and hereby incorporated by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that You have read and understand the rules of JAMS or waive Your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason.
        You and **CompanyX** agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services is personal to You and **CompanyX** and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.
        You and **CompanyX** agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this section 18 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the “FAA”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual. You and **CompanyX** agree that for any arbitration You initiate, You will pay the filing fee and **CompanyX** will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by **CompanyX**, **CompanyX** will pay all JAMS fees and costs. You and **CompanyX** agree that the province or federal courts of the province of Ontario and the Canada, Ontario have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.
        Any claim You may have arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services must be filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, Your claim is permanently barred, which means that You and **CompanyX** will not have the right to assert the claim.
